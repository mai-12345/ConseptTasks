# My-Solution-Concept

This repository contains solutions to three programming problems and algorithms that I have worked on as part of my studies. Below is a summary of the approach for solving each problem.

## Approach

Each solution is implemented with clarity, ensuring a step-by-step approach to solve the problem efficiently. The code uses common data structures and algorithms such as **lists**, **dictionaries**, and **sets**. The programming language used is **Python**.

## Problem 1: **Daily Steps Tracker**

### Problem Description:
This problem involves tracking the number of steps taken each day over the course of a month. The task is to:
- Find the **maximum** and **minimum** steps taken on any day.
- **Sort** the list of daily steps.
- Calculate the **average** number of steps.

### Approach:
- The user is asked to input a list of daily step counts.
- To solve the problem:
  - The **maximum** and **minimum** values are found using built-in functions.
  - The **average** is calculated by summing the total steps and dividing by the number of days.
  - The steps list is **sorted** in ascending order to provide an ordered view.

## Problem 2: **Library Book Borrowing Analysis**

### Problem Description:
Given a record of books borrowed from a library for a month, the task is to:
- Find the **most** and **least** borrowed books based on the number of days they were borrowed.
- Identify **unique titles** of books that were borrowed.
- **Sort** the books based on the number of days they were borrowed.

### Approach:
- The records of books and the number of days borrowed are stored in a **dictionary**, where the key is the book title and the value is the number of days borrowed.
- A **set** is used to identify unique book titles.
- The dictionary is sorted based on the number of days borrowed.
- The **most** and **least** borrowed books are determined by finding the maximum and minimum values in the dictionary.

## Problem 3: **Word Scramble Game**

### Problem Description:
In this game:
- A random word is selected from a predefined list of words.
- The letters of the selected word are **scrambled** randomly.
- The player has to guess the **original word** based on the scrambled letters.
- The player has 5 attempts to guess the word correctly.

### Approach:
- A word is selected randomly from a list of words.
- The letters of the selected word are shuffled using a random shuffling technique.
- The scrambled word is presented to the player, who is prompted to guess the original word.
- If the player guesses the word correctly within 5 attempts, they win; otherwise, the correct word is revealed after 5 incorrect attempts.

## Conclusion

- The solutions utilize common data structures like **lists**, **dictionaries**, and **sets** to efficiently store and manipulate data.
- The Python built-in functions such as `min()`, `max()`, `sum()`, `sorted()`, and `random.shuffle()` are used to perform the necessary operations for each problem.
- Each solution is designed to handle the requirements of the problem in a clear and simple way.
